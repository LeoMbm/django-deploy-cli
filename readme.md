# Django Deploy CLI
##### Generate your Procfile, runtime.txt and requirements.txt from the CLI

## TODO

* [] Choose a library to use for user interaction
* [ ] CLI will ask questions:
  * [] Check if file already exists...
    * Ask if they want to override
  * [] What is the name of the project ?
    * [] default to current directory name
  * [] Would you like to doing pip freeze ?
